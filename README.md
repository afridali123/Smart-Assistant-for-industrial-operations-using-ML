# Smart Voice Assistant for industrial operations using ML

## Introduction

Industry 4.0 technology helps you manage and optimize all aspects of your manufacturing processes and supply chain. Smart Voice assistants can control the operations where human intervention is not possible. assistants can help us to get Realtime analytics and operations controlled using voice commands.

Voice assistants like Alexa ,Google home can interact with and provide information. there is need of similar assistant specially for industrial control of Robots, sensors or any similar operation by recognizing one's voice commands.

Due to recent Covid-19 Pandemic, physical contact of surfaces are prohibited to prevent virus spread. In such cases, voice controlled operations and remote voice assistants really serve the purpose.

To prove the concept, I'm going to show voice controlled operations of industrial LED's, This assistant recognizes my voice and interact in the environment. Same concept concept will be works for voice control of movements, sensors and any other.
The entire ML algorithm will run on powerful embedded edge device called Raspberry pi 4; Its challenging to inference ML algorithms on edge devices that makes entire solution at very low cost to everyone.

This is very intelligent assistant that recognizes your voice only and respond or control operations accordingly.

## Hardware and Software Components

### Hardware Used :  
	1.Rasberry pi 4
	2.LED's (5V)
	3.USB Mic or Headset
	4.Connecting wires
	5.Puckjs

### Software Used :
	1.Python
	2.Speech recognition
	3.Espeak

## Demo Video

### Voice Controlled light operation using speech recognition | ML | AI | NLP | Embedded |

To prove the concept, i'm using Three different LED color - White, Red and Green. we are going to control the operation of this using Pretrained voice commands. you can change the commands and train the assistant on your favourite commands as well, check the code.

### Voice Controlled Machine to Machine communication

Here as next step, we are controlling the other embedded device wirelessly using Voice commands. In this video- i have raspberry pi and puckjs. the Speech recognition running on rasberry pi; Puckjs is small BLE IoT device programmable through web JavaScript. I'm going to control lights on puckjs Wirelessly (BLE or WiFi) using rasberry pi based on recognized voice commands. Same concept will be scaled to robot movements, sensing or any other control operations.

## Conclusion

Intelligent smart voice assistants are really can modernize, digitalize and transform our industries on many use cases. recognizing one's voice and then act accordingly may add security and easy operations where human's doesnt need to interact physically. Technology transforming the world. lets build cool stuff that makes our life easier. Finally im very happy to encourage if anyone want to further develop or improve this project.
