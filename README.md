# Smart-Voice-Assistant-for-industrial-operations-using-ML

## Introduction

Industry 4.0 technology helps you manage and optimize all aspects of your manufacturing processes and supply chain. Smart Voice assistants can control the operations where human intervention is not possible. assistants can help us to get realtime analytics and operations controlled using voice commands.

Voice assistants like Alexa ,Google home can interact with and provide information. there is need of similar assistant specially for industrail control of Robots, sensors or any similar operation.


To prove the concept, I'm going to show voice controlled operations of industrial LED's, same concept concept will be works for voice control of movements,sensors and any other.
The entire ML algorithm will run on powerful embedded edge device called Rasberry pi 4; Its challenging to inference ML algorithms on edge devices that makes entire solution at very low cost to everyone.
